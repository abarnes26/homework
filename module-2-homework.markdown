## Week 1

##### Ongoing
  * Reverse-engineer one of your favorite websites to practice your HTML/CSS skills.
  * [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)
  * Experiment with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).


##### Day 1
  * Finish styling TaskManager using Bootstrap `layout.erb`, `index.erb`, `show.erb`, `new.erb`, and `dashboard.erb`. [Here](https://gist.github.com/rwarbelow/da3ef21480b704305e68) is how to add a layout.erb file with a <%= yield %>. Don't spend more than 90 minutes on this. Timebox!
  * Research CRUD. Follow the directions in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/66ab6d4c5c8275499c1aab0d03dde1b0).
  * Reflect on Bootstrap. Follow the directions in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/da618bca9017148e7001719999160c0f).
  * Dive deep into [how the web works](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/6c166c78a3be3c8ba38545ff5e2b31ac) to prep for tomorrow's class. This might seem like a lot at first, but it shouldn't take you more than 30-45 minutes.
  * Read the "What is Rack" section (just the first one) in this [article](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2013/04/02/whats-rack/). 
  * Read [What is 'Rack' in Ruby/Rails?](http://blog.gauravchande.com/what-is-rack-in-ruby-rails)


##### Day 2
  * CRUD either Skill Inventory or Robot World. Instructions are at the bottom of [this file](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/crud_sinatra.markdown).
  * Add basic bootstrap and other custom styling to your Robot World or Skill Inventory. 
  * Research Capybara (a tool we'll be using tomorrow). The following resources are a good start:
    * [The Basics of Capybara and Improving your Tests](https://www.sitepoint.com/basics-capybara-improving-tests/)
    * [Capybara (software) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara_(software))
    * [Testing your App with Capybara](http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/)

##### Day 3
  * Continue working on Skill Inventory or Robot World. Add model and feature tests (using Capybara) that hit the routes in your controller. Timebox this to <= 2 hours.
  * Prep for tomorrow's Collaborative Communication session by reading these two (very short) articles:
    * [Ask Questions Instead of Giving Directions](resources/ask_questions.pdf)
    * [Mitigate Fault](resources/mitigate_fault.pdf)

##### Day 4
  * [Watch Sharif Ramadan's intro to 1NF, 2NF and 3NF databases. They're only about 4 minutes each.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7vzLrGCV50&list=PLQ9AAKW8HuJ5m0rmHKL88ZyjOIKejvrj0)
  * Suggested: 
    * Read the [Learn SQL the Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/) book.
    * [DevShed - An Introduction to Database Normalization](http://www.devshed.com/c/a/mysql/an-introduction-to-database-normalization/)
    * [Mike Hillyer's Blog Post - intro to database normalization](http://mikehillyer.com/articles/an-introduction-to-database-normalization/)
  * [Optional, but Highly Suggested] Work through the [Routing Playground](https://github.com/s-espinosa/routing_playground) to learn more about Sinatra routes.
  * [ActiveRecord Practice and Set Up RushHour](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/active_record_and_database_design.markdown)
  * [DTR for Rush Hour](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/38e212c799c563f58766128b5057858a). One group member should send link to forked gist to Casey.

## Week 4

##### Day 1

* Complete the [Sessions, Cookies, and Flashes](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/de7ee518ba2051338986838f66c31798) homework. 
* Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/134451454) on authentication to prep yourself for tomorrows lesson. 

##### Day 2
  * Authentication in BookShelf: Add functionality so that a user has many books and a book belongs to a user. A user can login and logout. A logged-in user can only see his/her books.
  * Modify your `most_recent_book` helper method to return that specific user's most recent book added. 
  * Add a belongs-to/has-many association between `book` and `category`. You **do not** need to create CRUD functionality for categories so long as categories can be created from `rails c` and the form to create a new book allows the user to select a category. You will need to do some Googling in order to figure out how to insert a select dropdown into a form. 

##### Day 3

User: 
 * can view index and show page for books that belong to self
 * cannot update users besides self
 * cannot create see or update other users books
 * can see a category show page with all associated books
 * cannot create, update, or delete categories

Admin: 
 * can create, update, read, and delete books. When creating a book they must assign it to a default user. 
 * cannot update users besides self
 * can CRUD categories

* Experimenting with APIs: Work through [this tutorial and workshop](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/exploring_apis.markdown) which will prepare you for extensions in your Rails Mini-Project and Little Shop.
